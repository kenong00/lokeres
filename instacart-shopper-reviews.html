                    <p align="justify">On may 3rd, 2022 my husband and i noticed a charge on our account for $235.00. There are lots of reports from the company’s shoppers on indeed though. How many hours you can work depends on instacart’s needs and your schedule flexibility. Jun 04, 2022 8:14 am. Placed a $25 order, card charged an additional $10 prior to delivery.</p>
